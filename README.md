# OpenGLFX-LWJGL-Sample
Sample LWJGL direct project for OpenGLFX

Documentation was not good enough to help new users get started with OpenGLFX.
Examples also did not contain all required imports and not in a stand-alone fashion.

This is a stand-alone MAVEN project for DIRECT rendering OpenGL within JavaFX using LWJGL3.
